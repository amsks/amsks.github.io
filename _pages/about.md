Researcher at the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/).

I am interested in exploring how agents can learn to abstract structure out of tasks and use this to adapt better to different classes of tasks. Thus, I am currently working on gaining further insight into generalization and domain adaptation in Reinforcement Learning and Meta-Learning. My greater research ambition is to create Robust and General Learning pipelines that require minimal handcrafting from humans. 


I previously completed my Master's in Autonomous Systems from the EIT double-Degree M
I have previously worked on problems in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, and Meta-Learning in single-agent and Multi-Agent settings.

Apart from making the world a better place (pun intneded), I also love to sing, play music, dance and cook.
If you wanna chat, just reach out to me via email.
