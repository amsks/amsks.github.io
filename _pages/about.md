<!-- Researcher at the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/). -->

I believe studying and explicitly utilizing information about problem structure can help us significantly improve squential decision making techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning.
Thus, I am interested in exploring how agents can learn to abstract structure out of tasks (the discovery problem) and use this to improve performance.

I completed my Master's in Autonomous Systems from [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) and [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), 
where my thesis focused on ad-hoc cooperation in Hanabi. 
I have previously worked on problems in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, and Meta-Learning in single-agent and Multi-Agent settings.

Apart from all of the research, I love to sing, play piano and guitar, compose music, dance and cook.
