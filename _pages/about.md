I believe that understanding the connection between the structure of a learning problem and the dynamics of learning algorithms (the interplay of learning objectives and hyperparameters) could help us significantly improve (Automated) design decisions in Reinforcement Learning and develop better optimization methods for (Meta-)RL algorithms, particularly in challenging exploration problems. Thus, I am interested in exploring how agents can learn to abstract structure out of tasks and use this to adapt better to different classes of tasks. My greater research ambition is to create Robust and General Learning pipelines that require minimal handcrafting from humans. 


I previously completed my Master's in Autonomous Systems from [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) and [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), where my thesis focused on ad-hoc cooperation in Hanabi. I have previously worked on problems in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, and Meta-Learning in single-agent and Multi-Agent settings.

Apart from all of the Reinforcement Learning in my life, I also love to sing, play piano and guitar, compose music, dance and cook.
