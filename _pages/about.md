<!-- Researcher at the [Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/en/). -->

Sequential decision-making problems in the real world often come with structure that is typically underutilized in Reinforcement Learning (RL). 
My work is dedicated to uncovering and leveraging this inherent structure. I focus on developing methods that enable RL agents to utilize rich contextual cues, temporal dependencies, and modular task structures, ultimately improving learning efficiency, generalization, and adaptability. My research spans areas such as Contextual RL, Meta-RL, AutoRL, and state abstractions, and I am particularly interested in self-supervised techniques that empower agents to learn without explicit labels or human intervention.

**Before my PhD:** I completed my Master's in Autonomous Systems from [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) and [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en), 
where my thesis focused on ad-hoc cooperation in Hanabi. 
I did a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communications Engineering from [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html), and worked for a year as a Risk Consultant with [KPMG](https://kpmg.com/de/de/home.html) before starting my Master studies.

**Beyond Research:** I have a passion for singing, playing piano and guitar, composing music (Here's a link to some music videos that I occasionally put up: https://www.instagram.com/melodic.musings/). 
I also enjoy cooking, reading up on a variety of topics and dancing.
